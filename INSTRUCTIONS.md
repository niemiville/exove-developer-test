# Developer test

**Please read the instructions carefully before starting the test.**

Return the test to jobs@exove.fi

This test has three sections, each having three or four questions. Your task is to choose one question per section. 

We recommend you to choose your questions according to what kind of tasks you are interested in real life. In other words, your choice of questions gives us a better understanding of your competence.

You need to answer at least one question per section in order to pass the test. If you end up answering more than one question in a section, we will use the highest grade of these questions to grade the section.

**Practicalities**

Do the back-end tasks with Javascript or PHP, Drupal tasks in PHP and front-end tasks with HTML, CSS and Javascript. You can use Typescript if you prefer it.

Do the test yourself, don’t ask for help from outsiders. If you have questions about the test, contact Exove at coding-test-help@exove.com. We’ll be responding to your questions during office hours (Mon-Fri) between 9-17.

After you have finished, return the tasks by creating a Github repository and send us the link to it.

### 2B. Create an SQL query

You have an SQL database with two tables, people and phones.

```
mysql> select * from people;
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | first_name | last_name   |
+----+------------+-------------+
|  1 | John       | Smith       |
|  2 | Mary       | Jones       |
|  3 | Gerhard    | Feuerhaufen |
|  4 | Rami       | Pitkäniemi  |
|  5 | Anna       | Kråkström   |
+----+------------+-------------+

mysql> select * from phones;
+----+---------+------------------+
| id | user_id | number           |
+----+---------+------------------+
|  1 |       2 | +1 213 621 0002  |
|  2 |       2 | +1 800 444 4444  |
|  3 |       1 | +1 604 444 4444  |
|  4 |       1 | +44 20 8759 9036 |
|  5 |       4 | +358 50 333 3333 |
|  6 |       5 | +46 771 793 336  |
+----+---------+------------------+
```
Create a single SQL query that will produce the following:
```
+---------------------+----------------------------------+
| name                | numbers                          |
+---------------------+----------------------------------+
| Gerhard Feuerhaufen | N/A                              |
| Mary Jones          | +1 213 621 0002,+1 800 444 4444  |
| Anna Kråkström      | +46 771 793 336                  |
| Rami Pitkäniemi     | +358 50 333 3333                 |
| John Smith          | +1 604 444 4444,+44 20 8759 9036 |
+---------------------+----------------------------------+
```

### 2C. Search for errors in the HTML

Search for at least 10 accessibility, validity and style errors in [this HTML](material/code.html) and fix them to the HTML. Return the whole fixed HTML.

## Section 3

### 3A. Get data and save it locally

Write code that gets data from a product API ([URL](material/products.json)) and saves it into an SQL database locally. For extra points note the following:
- Figure a way to save the hierarchical data (see product variations and categories for example)
- Figure a way to handle schemaless data (variations)
- Take into account that the database schema should support translations although the API doesn’t, use ISO 639-1 as language keys
- Add support for extra currencies
- How to update the product data from the API without re-saving everything but only parts that have changed
- Also note that not every object have IDs

### 3B. Continued from 2A, do two of the following:
- Separate elements into components
- Browse multiple comics/images from the top level
- If you chose to use Typescript, correctly type the code
- Use state to toggle dark mode


### 3C. Write a non-directional graph program

Write a program that counts the number of nodes in a non-directional graph and finds out whether there is a cycle in the graph

Examples of non-directional graphs:

Fig 1. A graph with a cycle

![A non-directional graph with a cycle](/material/non-directional-graph-cycle.png)

Fig 2. A graph without a cycle

![A non-directional graph without a cycle](/material/non-directional-graph.png)

### 3D. Write HTML and CSS for a provided layout 

Write the HTML and CSS for the simplified layout underneath. Also note that there might be more than three items present.

Make sure that one row has three columns if the window size exceeds 960 pixels and two if less. The extra item should drop to the next row.
